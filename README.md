# 8 Dynamics mini-site

This website is created for All We Can Save, to allow anyone interested in engaging with the climate crisis to self-evaluate where they are already strong, and where are the growth opportunities.

## Developing

This site is built with Svelte and SvelteKit. To get started developing, first install the dependencies (`npm install`). Then, whenever you want to start a development server run:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
